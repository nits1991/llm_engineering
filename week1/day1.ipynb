Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today.

    "## 📚 Key Takeaways: System Prompt Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **DO:**\n",
    "- **Be Specific**: The more specific your instructions, the more consistent the results\n",
    "- **Set Clear Expectations**: Define exactly what you want the AI to do\n",
    "- **Include Examples**: Show the AI what good responses look like (few-shot learning)\n",
    "- **Define Output Format**: Specify if you want markdown, JSON, bullet points, etc.\n",
    "- **Add Constraints**: Tell the AI what NOT to do or include\n",
    "- **Consider Your Audience**: Tailor the language and complexity appropriately\n",
    "- **Test and Iterate**: Try different versions and see what works best\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **DON'T:**\n",
    "- **Be Vague**: \"Be helpful\" is less effective than specific behavioral guidelines\n",
    "- **Overload with Instructions**: Too many rules can confuse the model\n",
    "- **Forget Context**: Consider what the AI knows and doesn't know\n",
    "- **Ignore Edge Cases**: Think about unusual inputs and how you want them handled\n",
    "- **Set Unrealistic Expectations**: AI has limitations - work within them\n",
    "- **Use Contradictory Instructions**: Ensure your guidelines don't conflict\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **System Prompt Iteration Process:**\n",
    "1. Start with a basic prompt\n",
    "2. Test with various inputs\n",
    "3. Identify failure modes or unwanted behaviors\n",
    "4. Refine the prompt to address issues\n",
    "5. Re-test and repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Pro Tips:**\n",
    "- Save successful system prompts for reuse\n",
    "- Version control your prompts (treat them like code!)\n",
    "- A/B test different versions to find what works best\n",
    "- Consider using prompt templates for consistency across projects"
