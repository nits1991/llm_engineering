    "* Training time scaling: Training large language models (LLMs) requires significant computational resources and time. As the size of the model increases, the training time tends to scale up due to the increased number of parameters that need to be optimized. This scaling is often non-linear, meaning that doubling the size of the model can lead to more than double the training time. Factors such as the complexity of the architecture, the amount of training data, and the efficiency of the training algorithms also influence training time scaling.\n",

Since the worm goes straight perpendicular to pages, the worm’s path will go through:\n",

       "- In Volume 1, starting at the first page, the worm must go to the back cover: that distance is: (pages in Volume 1) minus the first page portion not counted? However, since thickness measures total pages, the distance from the first page surface to the back cover equals the thickness of the pages portion after the first page. But for a standard puzzle, the commonly cited result is that the worm travels through the thickness of both covers and all pages except the inner ungnawed parts. The clean way: the total distance from the first page of Volume 1 to the last page of Volume 2 equals:\n",
       "  - The remaining thickness of Volume 1 from the first page to the far outer edge: essentially the entire thickness of Volume 1 minus the thickness of the front cover before the first page. The first page is right after the front cover, so the distance from the first page to the back cover includes the rest of Volume 1: pages (2 cm) + back cover (0.2 cm) = 2.2 cm.\n",
       "  - Then the thickness across the interface between volumes is the contact between back cover of Vol 1 and front cover of Vol 2; the worm must pass through those two covers? If the worm goes straight, it would go through the back cover of Volume 1 (0.2 cm) and through the front cover of Volume 2 (0.2 cm) as well as the entire pages of Volume 2 up to the last page? Since it ends at the last page of Volume 2, it does not need to pass through the entire volume 2; it stops at the last page, which is before the back cover. So it must pass through the front cover of Volume 2 and the pages up to the last page, which is the entire pages thickness (2 cm) minus nothing since it starts at the very first page of Volume 1 and ends at the last page of Volume 2.\n",
       "\n",
       "Putting it together carefully:\n",
       "- Through Volume 1 from first page to back cover: 2 cm (pages) + 0.2 cm (back cover) = 2.2 cm.\n",
       "- Through back cover of Volume 1 to front cover of Volume 2: 0.2 cm (the interface consists of two covers in contact; the worm would have to go through the back cover of V1 and then through the inner space? But the inner space is just the front cover of V2 touching; to move from inside V1 to inside V2, it must pass through the back cover 0.2 cm and the front cover 0.2 cm? The worm starts at first page inside V1 and exits through back cover of V1, then must go through the back-to-front interface, which is the inside surfaces of the two covers in contact; effectively the worm goes through the entire thickness of the back cover of V1 (0.2 cm) and the front cover of V2 (0.2 cm) to reach the interior of V2.\n",
       "- Through Volume 2 from the front cover to the last page: 2 cm (pages).\n",
       "\n",
       "Total gnawed distance = 2.2 cm (Vol1) + 0.2 cm (back cover V1) + 0.2 cm (front cover V2) + 2 cm (Volume 2 pages) = 4.6 cm.\n",
       "\n",
       "But many classic solutions yield 4.0 cm or 4.6 cm depending on interpretation. The standard neat result is: 2 cm (Vol1 pages) + 0.2 cm (Vol1 back cover) + 0.2 cm (Vol2 front cover) + 2 cm (Vol2 pages) = 4.4 cm? Wait sum: 2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 2 = 4.4 cm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Check arithmetic: 2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 2 = 4.4 cm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Where did 2 cm pages count come from both volumes: Yes, the worm travels through all pages of Volume 1 except the first page is start point, but starting at first page means it is at the very first page surface; to reach back cover, it must go through the rest of Volume 1 pages which sum to 2 cm (the entire pages thickness) since the first page is on the inner side of the front cover; to go to back cover, you traverse the entire pages thickness 2 cm. So it's 2 cm for Volume 1 pages, not \"2.0\" plus? The front cover thickness 0.2 cm would be before the first page, not included since starting at first page inside. So the distance in Volume 1 is only through the remainder: 2 cm (pages) to back cover, plus back cover 0.2 cm = 2.2 cm. But we counted 2 cm for pages; okay.\n",
       "\n",
       "For Volume 2, from front cover to last page: you start at the inner surface of front cover after passing through the interface; you must go through front cover thickness 0.2 cm plus pages 2 cm to reach last page? The last page is at the far end near back cover; to reach it, you traverse the entire pages thickness 2 cm. So 0.2 + 2 = 2.2 cm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Total: Volume1 part 2.2 cm + Volume2 part 2.2 cm = 4.4 cm.\n",
       "\n",
       "That seems consistent.\n",
       "\n",
       "Answer: 4.4 cm."

The Mariana snailfish sounds like an evolutionary nightmare wrapped in translucent goo, trapped in its own high-pressure prison. But don’t think you’ve won me over just yet. If it disintegrates in normal water, that’s basically the universe telling it, “Nice try, but you’re a one-trick pony.” Evolutionary masters? More like evolutionary hostages. So yeah, tell me more—unless you want to switch back to your usual vanilla topics.\n"

But that's what makes these creatures so fascinating - they're living proof that survival isn't always about being the strongest or most adaptable. Sometimes it's about finding your own incredibly specific niche and becoming weirdly perfect at existing there.\n",

They're single-celled organisms the size of your hand that build intricate, complex shells out of whatever debris they can find in the deep ocean - sand, microscopic shells, even tiny rocks. Imagine a cell so large and complex that it's basically constructing its own architectural masterpiece while living in total darkness. \n",
